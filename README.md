# Task-01: Population Distribution Visualization

## Project Overview

This project is part of **Prodigy InfoTech – Data Science Internship (Task-01)**. The objective of this task is to create a **bar chart or histogram** to visualize the distribution of a **categorical or continuous variable** using a real-world dataset.

For this task, we used a **population dataset from the World Bank** and created visualizations to understand the distribution of population across countries.

## Task Objective

* Load and understand the dataset
* Perform basic data cleaning
* Visualize the distribution of population data using:

  * **Bar Chart** (Top populated countries)
  * **Histogram** (Population distribution)
* Interpret the results

## Dataset Information

* **Dataset Name:** World Bank – Total Population
* **Source:** World Bank Open Data
* **File Format:** CSV
* **Key Columns Used:**

  * Country Name
  * Year (2022)
  * Population

> Note: The original dataset was semi-clean and required preprocessing such as removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas (Data manipulation)
* Matplotlib (Visualization)
* Seaborn (Visualization)
* Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## Visualizations Created

### 1) Bar Chart – Top 10 Countries by Population (2022)

* Displays the ten most populated countries
* Helps compare population size across countries

### 2️) Histogram – Distribution of Population (2022)

* Shows how population is distributed across all countries
* Highlights skewness in population distribution

## Key Observations

* A small number of countries have very large populations
* Most countries fall into lower population ranges
* The population distribution is highly right-skewed

## Conclusion

n this task, bar charts and histograms were successfully used to visualize the distribution of both categorical
and continuous variables from the dataset. The histogram helped in understanding how population values are distributed,
revealing that most countries fall within lower population ranges,while only a few countries have extremely high populations.
Bar charts were used to compare population values across different countries and years, making it easy to identify the most 
populated countries and observe population growth trends over time.
